Upgrade your cluster to the the latest HDInsight image                                           A cluster created one year ago does not have the latest image upgrades. Your cluster was created 1 year ago. As part of the best practices, we recommend you use the latest HDInsight images for the best open source updates, Azure updates, and security fixes. The recommended maximum duration for cluster upgrades is less than six months.

Hotfix - Upgrade to 2.6.14 version of the Async Java SDK v2 or to Java SDK v4                    There's a critical bug in version 2.6.13 (and lower) of the Azure Cosmos DB Async Java SDK v2 causing errors when a Global logical sequence number (LSN) greater than the Max Integer value is reached. The error happens transparently to you by the service after a large volume of transactions occur in the lifetime of an Azure Cosmos DB container. Note: While this is a critical hotfix for the Async Java SDK v2, we still highly recommend you migrate to the [Java SDK v4](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/sql/sql-api-sdk-java-v4).
