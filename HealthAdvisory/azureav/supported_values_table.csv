Hotfix - Upgrade to 2.6.14 version of the Async Java SDK v2 or to Java SDK v4                                                                                                            There's a critical bug in version 2.6.13 (and lower) of the Azure Cosmos DB Async Java SDK v2 causing errors when a Global logical sequence number (LSN) greater than the Max Integer value is reached. The error happens transparently to you by the service after a large volume of transactions occur in the lifetime of an Azure Cosmos DB container. Note: While this is a critical hotfix for the Async Java SDK v2, we still highly recommend you migrate to the [Java SDK v4](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/sql/sql-api-sdk-java-v4).
